# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3

![Newsroom](https://media.giphy.com/media/v2xIous7mnEYg/giphy.gif)

## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualisation position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analysing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."


## Your Task

You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Create a scatter plot using D3, that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file of your homework directory—make sure you pull in the data from `data.csv`.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
